# Enhanced YOLO on HoloLens
Object detection with YOLOv3, integrated with a Microsoft HoloLens front-end. This is an enhancement version for the original project by woodminus.

This project is based on two repositories:
* YOLOv3: https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3
* HoloLens, Unity, Azure Cognitive Services: https://github.com/misslivirose/unity-cognitive-services-demos

The goal of this project is to merge the two concepts: replace Azure Cognitive Services with a YOLOv3 service and use that in the Unity project for HoloLens.
