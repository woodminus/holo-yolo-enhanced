# Unity + Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API Demo
This is a demo project showcasing the [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api) Computer Vision API used in Unity, specifically for the Microsoft HoloLens running on the Universal Windows Platform. 

It includes the HoloToolkit components, as well as instructions for implementing the Cognitive Services computer vision functionality from a photo located locally on the device. This demo uses the streaming assets folder, but it can be applied to other images located in different directories.

## Setup
If you need instructions for setting up your machine for HoloLens development, check out the instructions on the [HoloLens Developer Site](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us/developers).

1. Sign up for a [Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api) Computer Vision API key. You will need this to access the API endpoints.

2. Clone the project to your local machine and open the project in Unity. 

3. Go to Scripts > ImageToComputerVisionAPI and replace the YOURVISIONKEYHERE string with your Computer Vision API key.

4. Run the application in the editor. Press 'P' to show the image on screen and the space bar to call the API request. The list of categories, as well as the category with the highest match, is printed in the debug console.

## Components
This demo contains the following components:

* FoundImageObject.cs: A class that wraps around the Computer Vision response returned by the API request
* ImageToComputerVisionAPI.cs: Script that handles the API call and returns the results as a JSON string
* ParseComputerVisionResponse.cs: Uses the JSON utility (included) to convert the JSON array to a list of FoundImageObjects
* ShowImageOnPanel.cs: Displays the photo onto a panel

## Scene Setup
The scene included to show the emotion API contains a main camera, set to the parameters for HoloLens, a 'ComputerVisionManagers' object which contains ImageToComputerVisionAPI, ParseComputerVisionResponse, and ShowImageOnPanel scripts, and an ImageFrame cube that displays the image when 'P' is pressed.

To change the photo analyzed in testing, replace StreamingAssets > cityphoto.jpg with your own image. If you rename it, update line 19 in ImageToComputerVisionAPI.cs to reflect the new image name.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Replace the following triggers with your own mechanism for selecting and displaying photos. 

Space: Calls the Cognitive Services API using your API key to validate and analyzing the sample photo 'cityphoto' in the Streaming Assets folder.

P: Display the image on the plane
